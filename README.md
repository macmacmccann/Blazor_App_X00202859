## Pipelines

The app was conected with a Yaml file on the dev branch in order  
It is coded to trigger status checks on push and pull of all branches  

Then the code is tested in many forms  

    Static Analysis  
    Code Coverage  
    Unit Tests  

A branch rule was created on the main respository to only allow collaboration if the status checks have passed
